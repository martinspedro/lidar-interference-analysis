@article{Levenberg1943,
abstract = {The standard method for solving least squares problems which lead to non-linear normal equations depends upon a reduction of the residuals to linear form by first order Taylor approximations taken about an initial or trial solution for the parameters .2 If the usual least squares procedure, performed with these linear approximations , yields new values for the parameters which are not sufficiently close to the initial values, the neglect of second and higher order terms may invalidate the process, and may actually give rise to a larger value of the sum of the squares of the residuals than that corresponding to the initial solution. This failure of the standard method to improve the initial solution has received some notice in statistical applications of least squares3 and has been encountered rather frequently in connection with certain engineering applications involving the approximate representation of one function by another. The purpose of this article is to show how the problem may be solved by an extension of the standard method which insures improvement of the initial solution.4 The process can also be used for solving non-linear simultaneous equations, in which case it may be considered an extension of Newton's method.},

@article{Gavin2019,
abstract = {The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed in the early 1960's to solve ne onlinear least squares problems. Least squares problems arise in the context of fitting a parameterized function to a set of measured data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors between the data points and the function. If the fit function is not linear in the parameters the least squares problem is nonlinear. Nonlinear least squares methods iteratively reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the function and the measured data points through a sequence of updates to parameter values. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combines two minimization methods: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the parameters in the steepest-descent direction. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic, and finding the minimum of the quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.},

@article{Zhengyou2000,
abstract = {We propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It is well suited for use without specialized knowledge of 3D geometry or computer vision. The technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipments such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

@article{Sturm2010,
abstract = {This survey is mainly motivated by the increased availability and use of panoramic image acquisition devices, in computer vision and various of its applications. Different technologies and different computational models thereof exist and algorithms and theoretical studies for geometric computer vision ("structure-from-motion") are often re-developed without highlighting common underlying principles. One of the goals of this survey is to give an overview of image acquisition methods used in computer vision and especially, of the vast number of camera models that have been proposed and investigated over the years, where we try to point out similarities between different models. Results on epipolar and multi-view geometry for different camera models are reviewed as well as various calibration and self-calibration approaches, with an emphasis on non-perspective cameras.We finally describe what we consider are fundamental building blocks for geometric computer vision or structure-from-motion: epipolar geometry, pose and motion estimation, 3D scene modeling, and bundle adjustment. The main goal here is to highlight the main principles of these, which are independent of specific camera models.},

abstract = {There exist many iterative methods for computing the maximum likelihood estimator but most of them suffer from one or several drawbacks such as the need to inverse a Hessian matrix and the need to find good initial approximations of the parameters that are unknown in practice. In this paper, we present an estimation method without matrix inversion based on a linear approximation of the likelihood equations in a neighborhood of the constrained maximum likelihood estimator. We obtain closed-form approximations of solutions and standard errors. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm which cycles through the components of the vector parameter and updates one component at a time. The initial solution, which is necessary to start the iterative procedure, is automated. The proposed algorithm is compared to some of the best iterative optimization algorithms available on R and MATLAB software through a simulation study and applied to the statistical analysis of a road safety measure.},

abstract = {Place cells are a fundamental component of the rodent navigational system. One intriguing implication of place cells is that humans, by extension, have "map-like" (or GPS-like) knowledge that we use to represent space. Here, we review both behavioral and neural studies of human navigation, suggesting that how we process visual information forms a critical component of how we represent space. These include cellular and brain systems devoted to coding visual information during navigation in addition to a location coding system similar to that described in rodents. Together, these findings suggest that while it is highly useful to think of our navigation system involving internal "maps," we should not neglect the importance of high-resolution visual representations to how we navigate space.},

abstract = {In order to obtain optimal 3D structure and viewing parameter estimates, bundle adjustment is often used as the last step of feature-based structure and motion estimation algorithms. Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational benefits can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell's dog leg non-linear least squares technique. Detailed comparative experimental results provide strong evidence supporting this claim. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},
