abstract = {LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems use one or more emitters and a detector array to cover a given field of view where the emitters each emit a single pulse or a multi-pulse packet of light that is sampled by the detector array. On each emitter cycle the detector array will sample the incoming signal intensity at the pre-determined sampling frequency that generates two or more samples per emitted light packet to allow for volumetric analysis of the retroreflected signal por tion of each emitted light packet as reflected by one or more objects in the field of view and then received by each detector.},

abstract = {Renal ischemia that occurs intraoperatively during procedures requiring clamping of the renal artery (such as renal procurement for transplantation and partial nephrectomy for renal cancer) is known to have a sig- nificant impact on the viability of that kidney. To better understand the dynamics of intraoperative renal ischemia and recovery of renal oxygenation during reperfusion, a visible reflectance imaging system (VRIS) was developed to measure renal oxygenation during renal artery clamping in both cooled and warm porcine kidneys. For all kidneys, normothermic and hypothermic, visible reflectance imaging demonstrated a spatially distinct decrease in the rel- ative oxy-hemoglobin concentration ({\%}HbO2) of the superior pole of the kidney compared to the middle or inferior pole. Mean relative oxy-hemoglobin concentrations decrease more significantly during ischemia for normothermic kidneys compared to hypothermic kidneys. VRIS may be broadly applicable to provide an indicator of organ ische- mia during open and laparoscopic procedures.},

abstract = {Signal interference between two light detection and ranging (lidar) scanners can occur when the transmitted laser energy from one lidar is scattered from a target and returned to a second lidar. By modeling lidar transmission paths via ray tracing, it is shown that signal interference can be modeled by the coincidence of intersection between two lidar transmission paths and a scattering target. The evaluation of experimental observation and an analytical framework of lidar signal interference is presented that compares results of a Monte Carlo simulation to interference observations from circularly scanning lidar sensors. The comparison between simulated and experimentally observed interference events suggests that lidar interference may largely explained by geometry and angular conditions. The model provides preliminary explanation as to the angular distribution of interference events and distinct transitions between occurrences of different interference modes. However, further radiometric refinement is likely needed to best explain the manifestation of some interference events.},

abstract = {Methods and systems for performing multiple pulse LIDAR measurements are presented herein. In one aspect, each LIDAR measurement beam illuminates a location in a three dimensional environment with a sequence of multiple pulses of illumination light. Light reflected from the location is detected by a photosensitive detector of the LIDAR system during a measurement window having a duration that is greater than or equal to the time of flight of light from the LIDAR system out to the programmed range of the LIDAR system, and back. The pulses in a measurement pulse sequence can vary in magnitude and duration. Furthermore, the delay between pulses and the number of pulses in each measurement pulse sequence can also be varied. In some embodiments, the multi-pulse illumination beam is encoded and the return measurement pulse sequence is decoded to distinguish the measurement pulse sequence from exogenous signals.},

abstract = {Autonomous automated vehicles are the next evolution in transportation and will improve safety, traffic efficiency and driving experience. Automated vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors (LiDAR, radar, camera, etc.) enabling lo- cal awareness of their surroundings. A fully automated vehi- cle will unconditionally rely on its sensors readings to make short-term (i.e. safety-related) and long-term (i.e. planning) driving decisions. In this context, sensors have to be robust against intentional or unintentional attacks that aim at low- ering sensor data quality to disrupt the automation system. This paper presents remote attacks on camera-based system and LiDAR using commodity hardware. Results from lab- oratory experiments show effective blinding, jamming, re- play, relay, and spoofing attacks. We propose software and hardware countermeasures that improve sensors resilience against these attacks},

abstract = {The LIDAR scanner is at the heart of object detection of the self-driving car. Mutual interference between LIDAR scanners has not been regarded as a problem because the percentage of vehicles equipped with LIDAR scanners was very rare. With the growing number of autonomous vehicle equipped with LIDAR scanner operated close to each other at the same time, the LIDAR scanner may receive laser pulses from other LIDAR scanners. In this paper, three types of experiments and their results are shown, according to the arrangement of two LIDAR scanners. We will show the probability that any LIDAR scanner will interfere mutually by considering spatial and temporal overlaps. It will present some typical mutual interference scenario and report an analysis of the interference mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract = {With the advancement in computing, sensing, and vehicle electronics, autonomous vehicles are being realized. For autonomous driving, environment perception sensors such as radars, lidars, and vision sensors play core roles as the eyes of a vehicle; therefore, their reliability cannot be compromised. In this work, we present a spoofing by relaying attack, which can not only induce illusions in the lidar output but can also cause the illusions to appear closer than the location of a spoofing device. In a recent work, the former attack is shown to be effective, but the latter one was never shown. Additionally, we present a novel saturation attack against lidars, which can completely incapacitate a lidar from sensing a certain direction. The effectiveness of both the approaches is experimentally verified against Velodyne's VLP-16.},

Each emitter/detector set emits and receives light energy on a specific coincident axis unique for that emitter/detector set. A control system coupled to the array of emitter/detector sets controls initiation of light energy from each emitter and processes time of flight information for light energy received on the coincident axis by the corresponding detector for the emitter/detector set. The time of flight information provides imaging information corresponding to the field of view. Interference among light energy is reduced with respect to detectors in the LiDAR unit not corresponding to the specific coincident axis, and with respect to other LiDAR units and ambient sources of light energy.

abstract = {In this paper, we examine crosstalk effects that can arise in multi-LiDAR configurations, and we show a data-based approach to mitigate these effects. Due to the ability to acquire precise 3D data of the environment, LiDAR-based sensor systems (sensors based on “Light Detection and Ranging”, e.g., laser scanners) increasingly find their way into various applications, e.g. in the automotive sector. However, with an increasing number of LiDAR sensors operating within close vicinity, the problem of potential crosstalk between these devices arises. “Crosstalk” outlines the following effect: In a typical LiDAR-based sensor, short laser pulses are emitted into the scene and the distance between sensor and object is derived from the time measured until an “echo” is received. In case multiple laser pulses of the same wavelength are emitted at the same time, the detector may not be able to distinguish between correct and false matches of laser pulses and echoes, resulting in erroneous range measurements and 3D points. During operation of our own multi-LiDAR sensor system, we were able to observe crosstalk effects in the acquired data. Having compared different spatial filtering approaches for the elimination of erroneous points in the 3D data, we propose a data-based spatio-temporal filtering and show its results, which may be sufficient depending on the application. However, technical solutions are desired for future LiDAR sensors.},
