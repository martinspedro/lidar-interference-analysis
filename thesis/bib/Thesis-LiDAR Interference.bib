abstract = {In this paper, we examine crosstalk effects that can arise in multi-LiDAR configurations, and we show a data-based approach to mitigate these effects. Due to the ability to acquire precise 3D data of the environment, LiDAR-based sensor systems (sensors based on “Light Detection and Ranging”, e.g., laser scanners) increasingly find their way into various applications, e.g. in the automotive sector. However, with an increasing number of LiDAR sensors operating within close vicinity, the problem of potential crosstalk between these devices arises. “Crosstalk” outlines the following effect: In a typical LiDAR-based sensor, short laser pulses are emitted into the scene and the distance between sensor and object is derived from the time measured until an “echo” is received. In case multiple laser pulses of the same wavelength are emitted at the same time, the detector may not be able to distinguish between correct and false matches of laser pulses and echoes, resulting in erroneous range measurements and 3D points. During operation of our own multi-LiDAR sensor system, we were able to observe crosstalk effects in the acquired data. Having compared different spatial filtering approaches for the elimination of erroneous points in the 3D data, we propose a data-based spatio-temporal filtering and show its results, which may be sufficient depending on the application. However, technical solutions are desired for future LiDAR sensors.},

abstract = {Signal interference between two light detection and ranging (lidar) scanners can occur when the transmitted laser energy from one lidar is scattered from a target and returned to a second lidar. By modeling lidar transmission paths via ray tracing, it is shown that signal interference can be modeled by the coincidence of intersection between two lidar transmission paths and a scattering target. The evaluation of experimental observation and an analytical framework of lidar signal interference is presented that compares results of a Monte Carlo simulation to interference observations from circularly scanning lidar sensors. The comparison between simulated and experimentally observed interference events suggests that lidar interference may largely explained by geometry and angular conditions. The model provides preliminary explanation as to the angular distribution of interference events and distinct transitions between occurrences of different interference modes. However, further radiometric refinement is likely needed to best explain the manifestation of some interference events.},
