abstract = {Autonomous automated vehicles are the next evolution in transportation and will improve safety, traffic efficiency and driving experience. Automated vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors (LiDAR, radar, camera, etc.) enabling lo- cal awareness of their surroundings. A fully automated vehi- cle will unconditionally rely on its sensors readings to make short-term (i.e. safety-related) and long-term (i.e. planning) driving decisions. In this context, sensors have to be robust against intentional or unintentional attacks that aim at low- ering sensor data quality to disrupt the automation system. This paper presents remote attacks on camera-based system and LiDAR using commodity hardware. Results from lab- oratory experiments show effective blinding, jamming, re- play, relay, and spoofing attacks. We propose software and hardware countermeasures that improve sensors resilience against these attacks},

abstract = {With the advancement in computing, sensing, and vehicle electronics, autonomous vehicles are being realized. For autonomous driving, environment perception sensors such as radars, lidars, and vision sensors play core roles as the eyes of a vehicle; therefore, their reliability cannot be compromised. In this work, we present a spoofing by relaying attack, which can not only induce illusions in the lidar output but can also cause the illusions to appear closer than the location of a spoofing device. In a recent work, the former attack is shown to be effective, but the latter one was never shown. Additionally, we present a novel saturation attack against lidars, which can completely incapacitate a lidar from sensing a certain direction. The effectiveness of both the approaches is experimentally verified against Velodyne's VLP-16.},

abstract = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for geometric alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the selection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine crosstalk effects that can arise in multi-LiDAR configurations, and we show a data-based approach to mitigate these effects. Due to the ability to acquire precise 3D data of the environment, LiDAR-based sensor systems (sensors based on “Light Detection and Ranging”, e.g., laser scanners) increasingly find their way into various applications, e.g. in the automotive sector. However, with an increasing number of LiDAR sensors operating within close vicinity, the problem of potential crosstalk between these devices arises. “Crosstalk” outlines the following effect: In a typical LiDAR-based sensor, short laser pulses are emitted into the scene and the distance between sensor and object is derived from the time measured until an “echo” is received. In case multiple laser pulses of the same wavelength are emitted at the same time, the detector may not be able to distinguish between correct and false matches of laser pulses and echoes, resulting in erroneous range measurements and 3D points. During operation of our own multi-LiDAR sensor system, we were able to observe crosstalk effects in the acquired data. Having compared different spatial filtering approaches for the elimination of erroneous points in the 3D data, we propose a data-based spatio-temporal filtering and show its results, which may be sufficient depending on the application. However, technical solutions are desired for future LiDAR sensors.},

abstract = {Signal interference between two light detection and ranging (lidar) scanners can occur when the transmitted laser energy from one lidar is scattered from a target and returned to a second lidar. By modeling lidar transmission paths via ray tracing, it is shown that signal interference can be modeled by the coincidence of intersection between two lidar transmission paths and a scattering target. The evaluation of experimental observation and an analytical framework of lidar signal interference is presented that compares results of a Monte Carlo simulation to interference observations from circularly scanning lidar sensors. The comparison between simulated and experimentally observed interference events suggests that lidar interference may largely explained by geometry and angular conditions. The model provides preliminary explanation as to the angular distribution of interference events and distinct transitions between occurrences of different interference modes. However, further radiometric refinement is likely needed to best explain the manifestation of some interference events.},

In one aspect, each LIDAR measurement beam illuminates a location in a three dimensional environment with a sequence of multiple pulses of illumination light. Light reflected from the location is detected by a photosensitive detector of the LIDAR system during a measurement window having a duration that is greater than or equal to the time of flight of light from the LIDAR system out to the programmed range of the LIDAR system, and back. The pulses in a measurement pulse sequence can vary in magnitude and duration. Furthermore, the delay between pulses and the number of pulses in each measurement pulse sequence can also be varied.

abstract = {A mathematical description of the intersection of a transmitted beam and a beam-like field of view between two stationary, coplanar, circularly scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) devices is presented. This beam intersection information establishes when scattered signal interference between two lidar devices can occur. Such interference may result in erroneous range data. The fraction of time over which the scanners' beams intersect is analyzed as a function of rotational frequencies and their reference phases. It is shown that the minima and maxima of this fraction are 0 and 1 / 2, with most configurations resulting near 1 / 4. A procedure to adjust the scan rates and phases to minimize this intersection time (including zero intersection) thus reducing the risk of mutual interference is also outlined. Four configurations that produce zero intersection between two scanners are presented. Configurations of three and four scanners are also presented for which no intersections between the scanners' transmission paths occur.},
