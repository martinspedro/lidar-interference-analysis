\section{Appendix B: Powering AVT Manta G-504C}
\label{sec:appendix-b}

To power the Manta G-504C, a laboratory benchtop was used. Manta consumes \SI{3.9 }{\watt}~\cite{MantaG504C} while operating, accepting an input voltage between \SI{8} and \SI{30}{\volt}$_\text{DC}$. The power source used was set to \SI{12}{\volt}$_\text{DC}$ and the current output was $\approx \SI{0.33}{\ampere}$. Voltage and current were measured during all tests, and summarized qualitative results are presented on table~\ref{tab:manta-power}.

The voltage errors were measured with a Univolt DT-64 multimeter and the current errors were measured on the power source digital display.}

The power cable provided is a U20 \ac{udp} cable with a HIROSE HR10A-10P-12S female connector. Since the mapping from the 8 pins \ac{udp} cable to the 12 pin connector was not available, a continuity test was made between the expected pinout of the power cable (for more details, see~\cite{AVTCables}) and its the real pinout. The results can be consulted on table~\ref{tab:manta-power-cable-pinout}.
